- My demo is available: https://profound-biscochitos-f372b7.netlify.app/recipe-page-master/recipe-page.html

- Through this practice, I have deeper understanding of checkbox, ordered list, use of media query, dynamic dimensions according to screen size.

- I spent time on Checkbox styling and custom List Number styling.

- My wisdom: the use of calc(), %, min, max and vw,.
